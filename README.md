###"in a land where css dies, and classes rise"

##Summary: This project was designed to include basics like bootstrap and font-awesome into a more powerful mix containing class css. What is this class css? Well it boils down to speed when generating template files. "marginTop50" would add a top margin to the specified element of 50px. "btn bg-blue text-white you just created button which has unique styles such as scaling on hover, then you set its background blue and font white. See how simple its becoming? 

##Rant
While i love css and beleive design to be at the center of development and the only important piece to the puzzle, i was done writing basic styles like "margin-top:50px;" - simply done. Made css boring and time consuming, no i have the time to focus on writing the program not the style. With this extra time i've been implementing css keyframe animation where needed. When your done wasting time with basics, you can roll straight into the meat of your project. JS / Templates roll through them quickly and efficently.

##Simple Setup:
1. Npm install
2. Bower install
3. gulp serve
